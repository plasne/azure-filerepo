## Making operational
The following steps are considerations for making this sample operational for your company.

* If deploying to Azure App Service the configuration parameters (ex. config/default.json) will need to be included in the source control system (ex. private GitHub repo) or a different method will need to be used. The recommendation would be to use "App settings" instead.

* The interface should be modified to meet your company's standards for branding and usability.

* There should be some consideration and process for deleting files and/or containers after a period of time.
